# whois

A Windows port of the UNIX whois command, implemented as a single executable compatible with all Windows versions.

## Usage

```
whois [OPTION]... OBJECT...
```

### Options

- `-h HOST, --host HOST`   connect to server HOST
- `-p PORT, --port PORT`   connect to PORT
- `-I`                     query whois.iana.org and follow its referral
- `-H`                     hide legal disclaimers

- `--help`                 display this help and exit
- `--version`              output version information and exit

These flags are supported by whois.ripe.net and some RIPE-like servers:

- `-l`                     find the one level less specific match
- `-L`                     find all levels less specific matches
- `-m`                     find all one level more specific matches
- `-M`                     find all levels of more specific matches
- `-c`                     find the smallest match containing a mnt-irt attribute
- `-x`                     exact match
- `-b`                     return brief IP address ranges with abuse contact
- `-B`                     turn off object filtering (show email addresses)
- `-G`                     turn off grouping of associated objects
- `-d`                     return DNS reverse delegation objects too
- `-i ATTR[,ATTR]...`      do an inverse look-up for specified ATTRibutes
- `-T TYPE[,TYPE]...`      only look for objects of TYPE
- `-K`                     only primary keys are returned
- `-r`                     turn off recursive look-ups for contact information
- `-R`                     force to show local copy of the domain object even if it contains referral
- `-a`                     also search all the mirrored databases
- `-s SOURCE[,SOURCE]...`  search the database mirrored from SOURCE
- `-g SOURCE:FIRST-LAST`   find updates from SOURCE from serial FIRST to LAST
- `-t TYPE`                request template for object of TYPE
- `-v TYPE`                request verbose template for object of TYPE
- `-q [version|sources|types]`  query specified server info

## Building

Requires MinGW with g++.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
g++ ../src/main.cpp -o whois.exe -static -lws2_32
```

## Running

```bash
./whois.exe example.com
./whois.exe 192.168.1.1
```

## Referral & Registrar behavior

This client follows referrals for domains by querying IANA/registry servers and then following the `Registrar WHOIS Server` entry to query the registrar. Registrar queries try a set of common formats (lowercase, uppercase, `domain `, `domain=`) and the program sends the entire query + CRLF in a single write — this resolves "Invalid Domain Name Format" responses from some registrars.

## Compatibility

This executable is statically linked and compatible with all Windows versions.
